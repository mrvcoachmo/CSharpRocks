# CSharpRocks

Unfortuantly I did not get time to implement the whole task. 

Having worked in Java the last 2 years, my C# skills have waned (and previous c# job 
was mostly legacy). 

I started with a TDD approach but I , not soon enough, realised that I was loosing time
setting this up. 

You should be able to Get data from the library and web service through the web api if nothing else.
